Codenames by Vlaada Chvátil is one of the best party games ever designed. It's easy to learn, supports almost any player count and rewards intelligence over luck.

We've play dozens of rounds of it, and turned on countless new players after a game or two.

Now, we want to make everyone's Codenames experience even better.

Presenting Spy Camera.

Spy Camera an iPhone app accesory for Codenames that uses augmented reality to show the spymasters the words their team needs to guess (and not guess!)
- Spymasters will no longer need to look back and forth from the the key card, to the board and back again to come up with clues
- As the game progresses, there will be no need to mentally “erase” clues that have already been guessed
- Gives the spymasters 3 ways to filter the key card. Red Team, Blue Team and Both Teams.

We're hard at work getting the first version to the app store. Join our mailing list to be notified of updates and to be invited to the **closed beta!**
