Computers brought us games that are infinitely complex sensory experiences. The internet gave us neverending opponents to do battle with.

With that progress came some tradeoffs.
Online screen names abstract the person behind the pixels. With the lack of emotional intelligence found in cyberspace, you might as well be playing an AI.

Taking turns to defeat a difficult level together. Yelling over each other in a split screen racing game. Lying to the face of your best friend about your faction. Local multiplayer gaming is a fun way to bring us closer together.

Somewhere between tabletop and video games lies the Eerie Island! Come join us!
