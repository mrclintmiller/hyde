*“You sneaky bastard!” My best friend of 20 years yells at me. I don’t feel bad in the slightest. Misleading him and the rest of my buddies is the most fun I’ve had in a while. We’re playing the best bluffing card game in the world. Skull.*

Skull is my favorite social deduction game because the rules are very simple. Every round, players place either a Skull or a Rose face down. Then they take turns declaring how many cards they can turn face up without revealing a Skull. If a player declares a number that nobody will out bid, they must flip over cards until they reach that number or they reveal a skull.

**The catch is that you have to flip over your own card first.** If you played a skull, you try to push other players to bid higher, but not so high that no one will exceed your bid. Losing a turn by flipping over your own skull is one of the most hilarious parts of the game. If you played a rose, you just want to win the bid and avoid turning over a skull. If you can do that, you get a point. The first person to two points wins.

Each player has 4 cards: 3 roses and 1 skull.  When you turn over a skull, you randomly discard a card. Nobody gets to know which card is discarded, but if you discard your skull it’s harder to win. If you discard all your cards, you are eliminated from the game.

A few other rules are important. Once everyone has placed their card face down, each turn a player can either bid OR add a second card on top of the first. This happens until one person starts the bidding. After that, you must either bid a higher number or pass.  

Skull always makes for a lively game table. It plays from 3 to 6 players and those players will be laughing and yelling every turn. It takes a minute to understand the concept, but after a few games it’s very easy to play.  And who doesn’t love deceiving their friends?
